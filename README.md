This JavaScript code creates a web app to search and display GitHub profiles. Users enter a GitHub username and click a button or press 'Enter' to fetch data from the GitHub API. The profile information, including avatar, name, username, join date, bio, repositories, followers, location, website, Twitter, and company, is displayed. If the user is not found, a "No Results" message appears. The app also allows toggling between dark and light modes, saving the preference in `localStorage` and respecting the user's system theme preference. The theme switch persists across sessions.
